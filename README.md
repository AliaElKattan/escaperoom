## Project Overview


Are you done with escape rooms where one dictators clamps on all the clues through the entire way? 
Join us at Escape Reality, where cooperation is the only way to success. 

Players will be locked in a virtual room in which there is are physical divides which cannot be crossed, 
with clues and keys to escaping dispersed across each room. The only way to get out is to talk and discuss 
what you see with each other, relaying back and forth crucial informations to solve tasks together.

Unlike conventional physical escape room environments, Escape Reality provides a procedurally generated tasks 
and challenge flows by which every game and room is different from another. In another word, you will never feel 
like youâ€™re re-doing the same game, and each new puzzle will be brand new for your experience. Furthermore, no 
game can be like another as the most important element in this game is cooperation, and each new players that you 
are locked in with will be able to offer unique interactions in that aspect.


Feel the thrill and suspense as you see the time ticking away for you to escape. Learn to work with a teammate 
through completing tasks together to escape the encroaching death. For in Escape Reality, whether it is the physically
separated space, signs and objects visible only to few characters of the game, or challenges that require a time based 
interaction along many parts of the room, the only way to success is through cooperation. The fulfillment you experience
as you escape a room with a friend will make you be closer than ever before. 

As the first networked VR escape room environment, Escape Reality offers a truly unique insight into what the 
future of escape rooms are. Join us at Escape Reality.

## DESIGN OVERVIEW

#### Background
The users of Escape Reality starts their experience in a lab. You are notified of the fact that you have been . Through either explanation or animation, leanr that your professor accidentally blew himself up while mixing up chemicals. Harmful gas is coming out. You, being an excellent student/ lab worker, realize that you only have a couple minutes to live before the harmful gas gets to you and kills you. Now it's up to you and your lab team to survive by concocting antidotes.
(Explain backstory)

(What is Role of user in this story)

(patterns, cognitive maps to convey this idea)

#### Core Interactions

(Describe Interaction)

(Why is this interaction tempting & meaningful)

(How is this indicated t the user?)


(Steps that user takes to initiate and complete the interaction)

(Consequence of the Interaction)

(How does the repetition not create boredom)


#### Visual Aesthetics

(Overall Style)

(Style in relation to the Emotions we wnat to generate)

(How we plan to produce this style - tools wise)

(mood board of 10-15 images of direction we go for)
Put them together in a single image file (using GIMP or Photoshop) and include the image here.


#### Sonic Environment

What does the audience member hear? Group them in three overall categories: sound effects, interface sounds and music. What is their character (e.g. metallic, smooth, melodic, organic), and how does that character tie in to the overall experience you are trying to build? You should have specific examples.


#### Interface of the Project
Describe the interface of your project.
How does the audience member interact with your project? How does the interface of your project allows her to understand what is going on and how to manipulate the state of the world? You should include sketches/wireframes of what the different interface elements should look like (e.g. potential titles, buttons, sliders, knobs). You should at least include one interface for joining your world, from the lobby room.

## EXPERIENCE OVERVIEW
(one page)
Describe the overall experience of the audience member. How do they join? Where do they start? What would they typically do? How would they conclude their experience? Emphasize the important moments and the transition moments.

Describe a specific moment. Try to be as precise and thorough as possible. Where does the audience member look? How do they move? What is going on in their head? What is a realistic, almost scientific depiction of the scene? How does the system look like at that moment? How does it evolve? This should be able to show the reader that you care about details and that you are not only thing in broad, abstract terms.

## CONCLUSION
(half page)
Remind the reader why your project is worth funding/presenting/experiencing.
Based on all that we are offering to our users, I think it is very clear why we are offering a unique experience to our users. We are offering a virtual world where you can experience the thrill of playing the escape room game wherever you want, whenever you want. Whats even better is the fact that our environment is different everytime you enter and play. This way you dont even have to deal with the limitations of the actual physical space. VR escape room is also going to be relatively inexpensive compared to what the physical one is.
