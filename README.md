## Description


Are you done with escape rooms where one dictators clamps on all the clues through the entire way? 
Join us at Escape Reality, where cooperation is the only way to success. 

Players will be locked in a virtual room in which there is are physical divides which cannot be crossed, 
with clues and keys to escaping dispersed across each room. The only way to get out is to talk and discuss 
what you see with each other, relaying back and forth crucial informations to solve tasks together.

Unlike conventional physical escape room environments, Escape Reality provides a procedurally generated tasks 
and challenge flows by which every game and room is different from another. In another word, you will never feel 
like youâ€™re re-doing the same game, and each new puzzle will be brand new for your experience. Furthermore, no 
game can be like another as the most important element in this game is cooperation, and each new players that you 
are locked in with will be able to offer unique interactions in that aspect.


Feel the thrill and suspense as you see the time ticking away for you to escape. Learn to work with a teammate 
through completing tasks together to escape the encroaching death. For in Escape Reality, whether it is the physically
separated space, signs and objects visible only to few characters of the game, or challenges that require a time based 
interaction along many parts of the room, the only way to success is through cooperation. The fulfillment you experience
as you escape a room with a friend will make you be closer than ever before. 

As the first networked VR escape room environment, Escape Reality offers a truly unique insight into what the 
future of escape rooms are. Join us at Escape Reality.
