## Project Overview


Are you done with escape rooms where one dictators clamps on all the clues through the entire way? 
Join us at Escape Reality, where cooperation is the only way to success. 

Players will be locked in a virtual room in which there is are physical divides which cannot be crossed, 
with clues and keys to escaping dispersed across each room. The only way to get out is to talk and discuss 
what you see with each other, relaying back and forth crucial informations to solve tasks together.

Unlike conventional physical escape room environments, Escape Reality provides a procedurally generated tasks 
and challenge flows by which every game and room is different from another. In another word, you will never feel 
like youâ€™re re-doing the same game, and each new puzzle will be brand new for your experience. Furthermore, no 
game can be like another as the most important element in this game is cooperation, and each new players that you 
are locked in with will be able to offer unique interactions in that aspect.


Feel the thrill and suspense as you see the time ticking away for you to escape. Learn to work with a teammate 
through completing tasks together to escape the encroaching death. For in Escape Reality, whether it is the physically
separated space, signs and objects visible only to few characters of the game, or challenges that require a time based 
interaction along many parts of the room, the only way to success is through cooperation. The fulfillment you experience
as you escape a room with a friend will make you be closer than ever before. 

As the first networked VR escape room environment, Escape Reality offers a truly unique insight into what the 
future of escape rooms are. Join us at Escape Reality.

## DESIGN OVERVIEW

#### Background

It's just another day at the super secret chemistry lab. You know, like a day of hacking through millions of chemicals with your lab mates, mixing and concocting deadly toxins that might just one day destroy the world. Hidden away in a normal office building up in the middle of New York City, the lab presents a cold and sleek, scientific vibe in contrast to the beautiful natural view outside. Out of nowhere, you hear a loud explosion at the corner of the lab. You see that the lab manager has mixed the wrong chemiclas and have just blown themself up while concocting a deadly neuro toxin virus, dying instantly. What's worse is that the lab manger is the one who holds all the passwords and keys to the lab's super secret layouts. As the barricade comes down from all sides of the lab as a preventative measure to isolate the deadly contagious virus within the room, you realize that you have but a few minutes to concoct an antidote to survive. The good news is that while you're limited to sections of the lab due to an electronic bomb strapped to your ankle for lab management purposes, there are people in all different sections of the lab that can work together to get out of this bind and escape this reality.


#### Core Interactions

There are two main interaction that users are faced with. One with the environment, and one with each other. In all senses, the users are placed under limitations by the environment. They are restricted by limited time (health bar UI that continually decreases due to toxin gas), they are restricted by physical space (the bomb that sets off if you step out of your given work zone), and they are restricted by physical abilities (cannot see something while looking at something else, the dark room limits vision). However, to overcome all of this, they have each other. This is why the latter interaction, the one with each other, becomes so meaningful. The users are but present with one challenge of creating the antidote, for which they must backtrack the interactions that they must complete. This clear goal and obscure means to acheive this goal is the driving force behind people to become more active. The results of this interaction will allow people to become true friends, as it is a well known rule that people who survive dangerous neurotoxin gas together must become friends. 

As there are but continual interactions with new environments, puzzles, and new people, the experience is always bound to provide a new pleasure, a new experience, and new friends.


#### Visual Aesthetics

(Overall Style)

(Style in relation to the Emotions we wnat to generate)

(How we plan to produce this style - tools wise)

(mood board of 10-15 images of direction we go for)
Put them together in a single image file (using GIMP or Photoshop) and include the image here.


#### Sonic Environment

What does the audience member hear? Group them in three overall categories: sound effects, interface sounds and music. What is their character (e.g. metallic, smooth, melodic, organic), and how does that character tie in to the overall experience you are trying to build? You should have specific examples.


#### Interface of the Project
Describe the interface of your project.
How does the audience member interact with your project? How does the interface of your project allows her to understand what is going on and how to manipulate the state of the world? You should include sketches/wireframes of what the different interface elements should look like (e.g. potential titles, buttons, sliders, knobs). You should at least include one interface for joining your world, from the lobby room.


There exist several interface mechanisms for users to understand that some objects are meant to be interacted with.
First and foremost, the users are provided with basic objects that one must interact with, for instance the goggles and the books for 


## EXPERIENCE OVERVIEW
(one page)
Describe the overall experience of the audience member. How do they join? Where do they start? What would they typically do? How would they conclude their experience? Emphasize the important moments and the transition moments.

Describe a specific moment. Try to be as precise and thorough as possible. Where does the audience member look? How do they move? What is going on in their head? What is a realistic, almost scientific depiction of the scene? How does the system look like at that moment? How does it evolve? This should be able to show the reader that you care about details and that you are not only thing in broad, abstract terms.

## CONCLUSION
(half page)
Remind the reader why your project is worth funding/presenting/experiencing.
Based on all that we are offering to our users, I think it is very clear why we are offering a unique experience to our users. We are offering a virtual world where you can experience the thrill of playing the escape room game wherever you want, whenever you want. Whats even better is the fact that our environment is different everytime you enter and play. This way you dont even have to deal with the limitations of the actual physical space. VR escape room is also going to be relatively inexpensive compared to what the physical one is.
